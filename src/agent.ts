3. Determine what level of technical depth is appropriate (beginner, intermediate, advanced)

- Add relevant code snippets with proper syntax highlighting
- Include references to authoritative sources (mark as "Reference needed: [description]" if you cannot provide exact URLs)
- Structure content with clear headings and subheadings

4. Any important considerations or best practices

3. Clarity: Is it well-written and easy to understand?
4. Examples: Are there sufficient code examples and real-world cases?
5. Structure: Is it well-organized with clear sections?

Respond in this exact format:
